							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I thought this article was extremely interesting, espeically when attempting to design or even when coding. I especially liked their representation of Hick's Law and their description of types of attention. This article wasn't very influential, but it has allowed me to think more about the psychology of designing an article and how people's attention changes when viewing something. I thought a good example was the cocktail party effect and how our spatial attention can only detect 5-9 objects at a time.   </p>
