			<li> I learned further about design and the idea of not just using apps, but studying them in order to better understand design. I also learned that each visible element on an application is a conscious decision from the design team (instead of having "Search Here", an application intentionally will put common search phrases in the search bar) </li>
			<li> I enjoyed reading the designer's thought process when she's designing. I also enjoyed reading about how we can utilize other apps to increase our eye for design.</li>
			<li> Quote: "By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself." </li>
			<li> Enjoyment from reading article: 6 </li>
