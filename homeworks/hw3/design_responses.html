						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the font that you choose is extremely important for the overall design and flow of your website. Certain fonts will convey messages better or worse (ie. there is a font that works better for children learning how to read). At the end of the day, the font you use is entirely up to you and how you want to design your website. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was seeing all the different fonts used. It's interesting to see how certain fonts fit better with a specfic design or even message. I also liked learning about pairing different fonts, which is something I struggle with.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
