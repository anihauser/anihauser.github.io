					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about animation from this article. I learned about the proper timing and duration for different animations when considering human nature. Afterall, animations are to increase human interaction with the user and hence, it's important we cater towards the user. I also learned about motion in animation and timing (overall, how to apply the physical world to our animations). </p>
						</li>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was the figure that showed the different speeds. I liked how they showed the different speed using different animals and it was actually entertaining to watch. The animals were cute and enjoyable. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
